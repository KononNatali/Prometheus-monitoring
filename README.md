# A monitoring solution for Docker hosts and containers with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor),[NodeExporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) and alerting with [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).

## Install

Clone this repository on your Docker host, cd into dockprom directory and run compose up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KononNatali/Prometheus-monitoring.git
cd dockprom

ADMIN_USER='admin' ADMIN_PASSWORD='admin' 
docker-compose up -d
```

**Caddy v2 does not accept plaintext passwords. It MUST be provided as a hash value. The above password hash corresponds to ADMIN_PASSWORD 'admin'. To know how to generate hash password, refer [Updating Caddy to v2](#Updating-Caddy-to-v2)**


Containers:

* Prometheus (metrics database) `http://<host-ip>:9090`
* Prometheus-Pushgateway (push acceptor for ephemeral and batch jobs) `http://<host-ip>:9091`
* AlertManager (alerts management) `http://<host-ip>:9093`
* Grafana (visualize metrics) `http://<host-ip>:3000`
* NodeExporter (host metrics collector)
* cAdvisor (containers metrics collector)
* Caddy (reverse proxy and basic auth provider for prometheus and alertmanager)

## Setup Grafana

Navigate to `http://<host-ip>:3000` and login with user ***admin*** password ***admin***. You can change the credentials in the compose file or by supplying the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables on compose up. The config file can be added directly in grafana part like this

```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:7.2.0
  env_file:
    - config
```

and the config file format should have this content

```yaml
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
```

If you want to change the password, you have to remove this entry, otherwise the change will not take effect

```yaml
- grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
```

Grafana is preconfigured with dashboards and Prometheus as the default data source:

* Name: Prometheus
* Type: Prometheus
* Url: [http://prometheus:9090](http://prometheus:9090)
* Access: proxy

***Docker Host Dashboard***

![Host](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Docker_Host.png)


You can find right value for your system in Prometheus `http://<host-ip>:9090` launching this request :

```yaml
node_filesystem_free_bytes
```

***Docker Containers Dashboard***

![Containers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Docker_Containers.png)

The Docker Containers Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring running containers:

* Total containers CPU load, memory and storage usage
* Running containers graph, system load graph, IO usage graph
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Container cached memory usage graph
* Container network inbound usage graph
* Container network outbound usage graph

Note that this dashboard doesn't show the containers that are part of the monitoring stack.

For storage and particularly Storage Load graph, you have to specify the fstype in grafana graph request.
You can find it in `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/docker_containers.json`, at line 406 :

```yaml
"expr": "(node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype=\"btrfs\"} - node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype=\"btrfs\"}) / node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype=\"btrfs\"}  * 100"，
```


You can find right value for your system in Prometheus `http://<host-ip>:9090` launching this request :

```yaml
node_filesystem_size_bytes
node_filesystem_free_bytes
```

***Monitor Services Dashboard***

![Monitor Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Prometheus.png)

The Monitor Services Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the containers that make up the monitoring stack:

* Prometheus container uptime, monitoring stack total memory usage, Prometheus local storage memory chunks and series
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Prometheus chunks to persist and persistence urgency graphs
* Prometheus chunks ops and checkpoint duration graphs
* Prometheus samples ingested rate, target scrapes and scrape duration graphs
* Prometheus HTTP requests graph
* Prometheus alerts graph

## Define alerts

Three alert groups have been setup within the [alert.rules](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules) configuration file:

* Monitoring services alerts [targets](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L2-L11)
* Docker Host alerts [host](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L13-L40)
* Docker Containers alerts [containers](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L42-L69)

You can modify the alert rules and reload them by making a HTTP POST call to Prometheus:

```bash
curl -X POST http://admin:admin@<host-ip>:9090/-/reload
```

***Monitoring services alerts***

Trigger an alert if any of the monitoring targets (node-exporter and cAdvisor) are down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: monitor_service_down
    expr: up == 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Monitor service non-operational"
      description: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down."
```

***Docker Host alerts***

Trigger an alert if the Docker host CPU is under high load for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: high_cpu_load
    expr: node_load1 > 1.5
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server under high load"
      description: "Docker host is under high load, the avg load 1m is at {{ $value}}. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Modify the load threshold based on your CPU cores.

Trigger an alert if the Docker host memory is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_memory_load
    expr: (sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) - sum(node_memory_MemFree_bytes + node_memory_Buffers_bytes + node_memory_Cached_bytes) ) / sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server memory is almost full"
      description: "Docker host memory usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Trigger an alert if the Docker host storage is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_storage_load
    expr: (node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"} - node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype="aufs"}) / node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"}  * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server storage is almost full"
      description: "Docker host storage usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

***Docker Containers alerts***

Trigger an alert if a container is down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_down
    expr: absent(container_memory_usage_bytes{name="jenkins"})
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins down"
      description: "Jenkins container is down for more than 30 seconds."
```

Trigger an alert if a container is using more than 10% of total CPU cores for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_high_cpu
    expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{name="jenkins"}[1m])) / count(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"}) * 100 > 10
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins high CPU usage"
      description: "Jenkins CPU usage is {{ humanize $value}}%."
```

Trigger an alert if a container is using more than 1.2GB of RAM for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: jenkins_high_memory
    expr: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{name="jenkins"}) > 1200000000
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Jenkins high memory usage"
      description: "Jenkins memory consumption is at {{ humanize $value}}."
```

## Setup alerting

The AlertManager service is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus server.
AlertManager can send notifications via email, Pushover, Slack, HipChat or any other system that exposes a webhook interface.
A complete list of integrations can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration).

You can view and silence notifications by accessing `http://<host-ip>:9093`.

The notification receivers can be configured in [alertmanager/config.yml](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/alertmanager/config.yml) file.

To receive alerts via Slack you need to make a custom integration by choose ***incoming web hooks*** in your Slack team app page.
You can find more details on setting up Slack integration [here](http://www.robustperception.io/using-slack-with-the-alertmanager/).
